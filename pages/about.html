    <li>Before beginning my PhD, I was a research assistant at the BCN-MedTech unit. During 15 months, I developed 
        outcome prediction models of critical patients with cerebral, vascular, and cardiac diseases. 
        My position was funded by the European Union as part of the
        <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GEMINI Horizon Europe Project</a>.
    </li>
    <li>In 2023, I completed an MRes in AI and Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperial College London</a>.
        There, I investigated the generalization capabilities of Bayesian distributional policy gradients applied to sequential, pharmacological decision-making. 
        I was fully funded by a <a href="https://becarios.fundacionlacaixa.org/en/joel-romero-hernandez-B005785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"la Caixa" Foundation fellowship abroad</a>.
    </li>
    <li>I majored in Biomedical Engineering at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) in 2022. 
        My bachelor's thesis explored the integration of value-based deep reinforcement learning 
        with stochastic automata and genetic algorithms to simulate chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
        and monoclonal antibody therapy policies for non-small cell lung cancer.
        During my undergraduate studies, I pursued research internships at 
        <a href="https://www.attuneneuro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attune Neurosciences</a>, 
        the <a href="https://dsb.upf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Systems Biology Lab @ UPF</a>, 
        and the <a href="https://synbio.upf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Translational Synthetic Biology Lab @ UPF</a>, 
        all focusing on the study of complex diseases with computational models and simulations.
    <li>Prior to college, I did summer internships at the 
         <a href="https://www.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in 2017 and at 
          <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weizmann Institute of Science</a>  in 2018, both focused on molecular
        biology. These stays were funded by the <a href="https://www.cee.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Excellence in Education</a> 
        and <a href="https://www.fundaciocatalunya-lapedrera.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundaci√≥ Catalunya-La Pedrera</a>.
