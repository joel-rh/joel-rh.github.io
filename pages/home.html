<p>
    My research focuses on the modeling and control of complex systems, 
    especially for medical applications.

    <li>
        I am pursuing a PhD in medical artificial intelligence at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a> with the support of a Joan Or√≥ research grant.
        Specifically, I am part of the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/bcn-medtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCN-MedTech</a> 
        unit within the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/enginyeria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Engineering</a> 
        and the <a href="https://www.complexsystemslab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICREA-Complex Systems Lab</a> 
        within the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/en/web/biomed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Medicine and Life Science</a>.
     
    <li> 
        I am currently working on foundational deep learning models that approximate the physiological dynamics of critically ill patients, 
        simulate their response to various pharmacological interventions, and optimize multi-objective treatment policies. </li>
